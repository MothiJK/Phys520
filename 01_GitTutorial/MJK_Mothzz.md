Assignment 1 - Q&A

1. Things I like about GitHub - I like how Github encourages collaboration to have multiple people work on a script / code. I also like how constantly keeps track of changes 

2. Things I dislike about GitHub - There is a lot of jargon around github and it's commands which are hard to remember, also I don't like or rather not sure about how to address merging conflicts.  

3. Questions about GITHUB - Does Github have some sort of shortcuts? I think there is a way to automate workflows with Github actions, I'm interested in knowing if there are specific commands or actions to automate workflows and repository actions.
