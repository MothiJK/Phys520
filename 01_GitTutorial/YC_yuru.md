# Introduction to Git
 
Takehome message: **Use git**

## Assignment
Clone https://github.com/beards-lab/Phys520

- Create a initials_your-nick-name.md into the 01_GitTutorial folder
  - E.g. FJ_jez.md
- Write down what you 
  1. like about GitHub
    - This first time using github.. I like the green grid showing the effort everyday (it will be better if I can hide it as well)
  2. dislike about GitHub
  - kinda redundant, and sometime opening files opens my pycharm, and some time it goes to my rstudio.
  3. At least one question
  - Will there only be one administrator for each repository? 
  - If I edit the gitignore file, I make some file visible and not visible. Why you said it was not reversible?

In readme.md
