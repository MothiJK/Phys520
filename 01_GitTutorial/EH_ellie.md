## Assignment

1) I like how GitHub makes it easy to undo mistakes. It seems like there is minimal risk of losing data/files when using GitHub.

2) I think dealing with several collaborators and a large number of files or branches could become very complex, though I'm sure this becomes more manageable with more GitHub practice.

3) Is it possible to unmerge branches after the merged branches have been pushed?
