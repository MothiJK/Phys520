## Assignment
1. Can easily track changes in the history and have the option to revert changes if you make a mistake. If there is conflict among the files, it tells us to resolve it.

2. Because you can have multiple branches and the remote repository may not be always updated (didn't push for some reason), managing the files can be confusing. Unless the user is very organized, some of the changes are hard to track. Also, the terminology is confusing (push, pull, fork).

3. Can you merge repositories? Would duplicated file names (such as a readme file) cause conflict if you can merge repositories? Can you share a private repository (without making it public for everyone)?
